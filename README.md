**MoonPlus** is a WIP module for [MoonLoader](http://blast.hk/moonloader/) that gives Lua modders easier access to properties and functions of various game objects, such as:
- Placeable (Most things with position).
- Entity (Buildings and most things that can be rendered)
- Physical (Most things with collision)
- Peds
- Vehicles/Automobiles
- Weapons
- Weather
- Access to noise generation and normal distribuition functions
